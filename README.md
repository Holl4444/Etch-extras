## Overview
A version of the classic Etch-a-Sketch. Adjust the number of tiles to choose a more or less detailed canvas. As you hover over tiles they will change to a random colour. Hold down the space bar to move over the grid without changing squares. Use Darken Mode to gradually darken a tile each time you hover over it.

## The Process
Building on from a project from The Odin Project. I wanted to challenge myself and picked a few points to cover:
* Adding a pen-up feature
* Randomising the square colours
* Creating the darken mode

## Key Takeaways
* Real familiarity with DOM manipulation

## Continued Development
* Adding an eraser
* Making the default square black for a clearer picture.
